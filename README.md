- I have 5 years of experience in Python, which is the main language I used everyday at workplace. I can develop machine learning and simulation algorithms, build data engineering pipelines, handle data in different data type, leverage various packages, and develop useful tools for the team.
- I have 2 years of experience in SQL. I read/write database and concat data from multiple data sources at various scales as a daily basis during my role as a Data Scientist.
- I can proficiently maintain repositories and branches with Git and setup best practices for the team.

This repository demonstrates part of the relevant code I've developed. The following section introduces the files in this repository:
### cloudStorageTool.py
The tools I built for the team to better leverage Google Cloud Storage.

### MultithreadingTool.py
